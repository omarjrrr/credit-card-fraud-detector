# 🎯 Credit Card Fraud Detection Demo  

Live App: [🔗 Streamlit Demo](https://credit-card-fraud-detector-39uwuatuofkbhjv3jiygn4.streamlit.app/)

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was developed  to demonstrate practical experience with **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** concepts.

The goal is to **simulate a credit card fraud detection system** using a trained  
**Logistic Regression model** and an interactive **Streamlit web interface**.

The live app uses **partially randomized inputs** to mimic realistic transaction behavior.  
Therefore, the predictions displayed in the app are for **educational and visualization purposes only**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a **showcase demo**, not a production-ready financial system.  
It was created to illustrate:

- How fraud detection systems process transaction data  
- How machine learning models classify transactions as *fraudulent* or *legitimate*  
- How to deploy a predictive model using Streamlit  

All displayed results are **simulated** and **should not be used for real financial decisions**.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- Data preprocessing & feature scaling  
- Logistic Regression model training  
- Streamlit front-end development  
- Model deployment using `joblib`  
- Probability calibration & result visualization  
- Building a complete end-to-end ML demo
